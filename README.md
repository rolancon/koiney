# Koiney

Koiney is an alternative way to transliterate [Hellenistic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek) (also known as Koine Greek) to the Latin alphabet. It adopts some principles from the traditional transliteration of Koine Greek, updated with some indicators of Koine Greek pronunciation, skips non-essential differences, and uses all letters in the Latin alphabet to cover all desired features without having to resort to diacritics.
